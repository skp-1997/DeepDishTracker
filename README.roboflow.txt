The dataset includes 1921 images.
Small_plate, big_plate are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
